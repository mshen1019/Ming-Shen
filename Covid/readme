Our conclusion:
1. Between Sept 1st, 2020 and Nov 4th, 2020, states with the mostly daily new cases per million people(NCPM) are usually red states.
2. After Nov 4th, 2020, the daily new cases per million people(NCPM) in blue states rises up a lot, but red states still have more daily new cases per million people(NCPM) averagely.
