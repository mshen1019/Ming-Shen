# Fashion_mnist with Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks

It is too slow to generate PDF of R notebook, so I just attached R code.
The CNN model for this dataset is much slower and its performance is slightly better. 
The accuracies of Model_init, Model_bigger and Model_Convolution are 0.8891, 0.9395 and 0.9407.
